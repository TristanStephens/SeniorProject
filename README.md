# SeniorProject

The goal of this project was to follow the Software Development Lifecycle in its fullest. We started with a three person group
but were left with two people by the end of the semester. This made it difficult to complete the entire project but we stepped
through each step as thoroughly as possible.

My portion of the project consisted of designing a new interface for the users to input data into the database. I attempted
to make a self contained app that interfaces with microsoft azure login system and modified the data on the server side via
commands from the client. It was my intention to put more into the project but in the end we were left with little time and
had a small demo available to the client (our teacher). In the end it was a success and we received an A grade on the project.

Included are some of my mockup designs and pdfs illustrating the though into managing the program. I also did some backend setup
with the azure server to get it linked to the program but it was incomplete in the end.
